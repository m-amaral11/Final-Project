# Final-Project - Seizure Recognition Project

Project Goal:

Epileptic seizures are characterized by transient and abnormally excessive neuronal activity in the brain. These sudden electrical disturbances lead to various symptoms, such as brief periods of unresponsiveness, convulsions, muscle spasms, or even prolonged unconsciousness. An electroencephalogram (EEG) is a crucial diagnostic tool that captures electrical signals in the brain, helping neurologists detect unusual patterns that can indicate the presence and localization of a seizure.

This project aims to develop a predictive model for epileptic seizure recognition using EEG data. With machine learning techniques, I aim to use the information in the EEG records for more accurate and quicker identification of seizure events.

Such an algorithm could be beneficial for real-time monitoring of patients, automated diagnosis support, and even in the development of alert systems for individuals at high risk of seizures. Additionally, data visualization through Tableau will make these complex EEG data sets more comprehensible to facilitate a better understanding for both medical practitioners and patients alike, providing insights into the brain wave patterns.

Timeline:
Day 1: Understand, clean, and preprocess the data for analysis.
Day 2: Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize patterns and relationships.
Day 3: Begin model development and conduct initial testing.
Day 4: Iterate on the models and fine-tune hyperparameters.
Day 5: Start designing and building comprehensive Tableau dashboards to visualize findings.
Day 6: Refine Tableau visualizations and prepare the final presentation.
Day 7: Present findings and gather feedback for further refinement.
